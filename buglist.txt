Bugs:

1. Enqueue/PeekFront bug: Enqueue either does not update the m_front pointer or is enqueuing
the element to the front of the queue instead of to the back. The front pointer stays at
the most recent element added to the list. example: when enqueue(2) then enqueue(3),
peekFront returns 3, but it should return 2. when enqueue(2) then enqueue(3) then
enqueue(4), peekFront returns 4, but it should return 2.

2. The documentation says there dequeue should return the value of the entry at the
front of the queue but it doesn't. Dequeue is a void function--it returns nothing.

3. Dequeue: Dequeue doesn't work because enqueue has a bug in it. If enqueue
did not have a bug, the dequeue would work as expected. Test 7 fails because Enqueue
is broken. I could make test 7 pass by adjusting for the behavior of enqueue.

4. PeekFront: Doesn't work because enqueue has a bug in it. If enqueue did not have
a bug, peekFront would work as expected. Test 10 fails because enqueue is broken.
I could make test 10 pass by adjusting for the behavior of enqueue.
